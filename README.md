# community.flake.parts

A place to host documentation for [flake modules](/modules) created using [flake-parts](https://flake.parts/).

We use [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/) to serve the documentation from their individual repos.

TODO: Describe the model.

## Local

In nix shell,

```bash
just run
```

## TODO: Guidelines for writing docs

- [ ] Paths map to URLs; structure builds from folders OR branching links
- [ ] Wikilinks
- [ ] `nix run` and `.#preview`
